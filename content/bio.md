### Early Years & Education

---

Miguel Di Lalla was born in Caracas in 1998, part of a generation raised between the promise of the digital revolution and the shifting political tides of Latin America. After completing three years of university studies in Metallurgical Engineering at the Central University of Venezuela, he made the bold decision to emigrate to Spain. With an Italian passport and a clear sense of purpose, he arrived in Tenerife to visit a close friend and soon found the conditions to begin his adult life.

### Professional Growth

---

What started as a short visit evolved into a formative chapter. Accessing the job market through hospitality, Miguel gained financial independence, built confidence in his English, and honed his interpersonal skills by engaging with people from all over the world.

> *"Hospitality taught me how to manage stress in demanding environments—and the immense value of emotional intelligence."*

---

### Passion for Learning

---

Yet Miguel never stopped feeling that his true home was in spaces of learning. His childhood was shaped by technical documentaries, scientific content, philosophical reflection, and classrooms where his greeting was often: “Did you know…?”. He originally aspired to study Physics and Psychology, but chose Materials Engineering as a pragmatic middle ground—seeking the closest path to the physical world’s inner workings. He naturally excelled in the sciences, especially programming, where he fondly recalls solving assignments alongside his friend Andrea, turning every algorithm into a playground of creative refinement.

> *"The classroom has always been my habitat. It's where I breathe best."*

### Self-Guided Learning Journey

---

Aware that a formal university title is not the only indicator of talent, Miguel embraced a new way of learning—self-guided and rooted in cutting-edge technology. Through platforms like Coursera, GitHub, YouTube, and tools like ChatGPT Plus and GitHub Copilot Pro, he built his own technical learning environment. He uses language models not only as assistants but as mentors—refining ideas, writing, prototyping, and exploring technologies.

> *"I study with the tools of the future to earn my place in the present."* 🤖

### Flagship Project: LEGO Bricks ML Vision

---

This journey has culminated in a portfolio project that now stands at the heart of his professional candidacy: **LEGO Bricks ML Vision**. It's a full computer vision system designed to identify and classify LEGO bricks from images. Inspired by childhood play, Miguel asked a deceptively simple question:

> *"If I can recognize a LEGO piece instantly, can a machine learn to do the same?"*

The project evolved from a straightforward idea into a technically rich architecture that integrates **YOLOv8 for detection**, **keypoint detection for stud mapping**, and a regression-based algorithm to classify bricks by shape. Miguel not only demonstrated technical acumen, but also crafted a polished CLI experience—visually clear, intuitive, and fully documented.

> *"Every ML model begins like a sketch: an idea, a draft, a thousand mistakes—and finally, a solution that breathes."* 🌈

This project is his manifesto—entirely self-built, self-financed, and driven by a deep belief that learning, when fueled by passion, can be transformative.

### Current Opportunity: PONOS Initiative

---

Currently, Miguel is part of **PONOS**, a local youth employment initiative offering a fully subsidized three-month position in a company, with his salary funded by the regional government. This represents a unique opportunity for any employer looking for raw talent with exceptional growth potential.

> *"What I offer isn’t just knowledge—I offer direction, enthusiasm, and a grounded will to grow."* 🌟

Miguel is ready to make the leap. His story, which began in an industrial workshop in Caracas and continued through restaurant shifts and library coding sessions in Tenerife, is a story of courageous transition. Now, he seeks a company willing to bet on the future—on someone who has already proven he’ll learn whatever it takes to bring value from day one.
