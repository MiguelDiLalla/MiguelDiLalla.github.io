## 🔹 Short Professional Bio

```md
🚀 From Hospitality to Machine Learning | Bridging Logic, Creativity & Impact

Hi, I’m Miguel Di Lalla — a self-driven engineer with a background in hospitality and a passion for building elegant machine learning pipelines. My first full-stack ML project, LEGO Bricks ML Vision, showcases my ability to turn abstract problems into concrete solutions using YOLOv8, custom geometry-based algorithms, and modular CLI tools.

🔧 Focus: ML Ops, Computer Vision, Tooling, and UX for AI.
💡 Belief: "AI isn't magic—it's logic amplified with empathy."

Let's build solutions that are as functional as they are delightful.

## 🔹 Project Description

```md
# LEGO Bricks ML Vision 🔍🧱

A complete machine learning pipeline for detecting and classifying LEGO bricks from images, designed with reproducibility, usability, and storytelling in mind.

👨‍🔧 Built from scratch:
- Dual detection models (bricks + studs) using YOLOv8
- Custom classification algorithm based on stud layout geometry
- Full-featured CLI with rich visual feedback
- Metadata fingerprinting for traceability
- Designed for GitHub execution (no Docker required)

🎯 Technologies: PyTorch, Ultralytics, Click, Rich, Albumentations, OpenCV

## 🔹 Career Transition Highlight

```md
🎯 Career Pivot: From the chaos of hospitality to the structure of ML pipelines.

I leveraged my work ethic, fast problem-solving, and visual thinking from years in hospitality to train object detection models, structure automation workflows, and build user-friendly tools in Python.

My first real-world project — LEGO Bricks ML Vision — is a full-stack AI case study that includes:
✅ YOLOv8 model training (single + multiclass)
✅ Custom dimension classification using spatial logic
✅ CLI-based UX with emojis, logging, and metadata injection
✅ Rich documentation and repo structure for clarity

I’m now seeking my first opportunity in ML/Data Engineering/AI Tooling.

## 🔹 Custom DM Template (Recruiters / Collaborators)

```md
Hi [Name], I hope you’re doing well! I’m reaching out because I’ve recently completed my first full-stack ML project — LEGO Bricks ML Vision — where I designed a complete computer vision pipeline with YOLOv8, custom classification logic, and a user-friendly CLI tool.

It reflects not just my technical skills but also my journey into tech from hospitality, and my ability to communicate solutions clearly.

If you’re ever hiring for someone with hands-on vision project experience (plus a creative mindset), I’d love to connect or get your feedback. 😊
