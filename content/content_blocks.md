## 👋 About

From hospitality to AI — I’m a machine learning engineer who builds joyful, human-focused tools.

My journey into tech didn’t start in a lab. It started on the restaurant floor, where I learned patience, stress management, and how to think on my feet. But deep down, I’ve always been a builder.

As a kid, I was obsessed with LEGO bricks. Now, I use code to build things that solve problems and tell stories.

This website is my launchpad — and an invitation to connect.

## 🧱 Project: LEGO Bricks ML Vision

> Can I teach a machine to recognize LEGO bricks like I do?

This was the question that launched my first full machine learning case study. I developed an object detection pipeline using YOLOv8 to detect LEGO bricks and their studs, then combined that with classic geometry to infer their dimensions.

The project includes:
- Two YOLO models (bricks + studs)
- Manual annotations + automated EXIF metadata embedding
- CLI interface with emojis, logs, and batch processing
- Fully reproducible pipeline + public demo images

It’s a case study in ML, engineering, and presentation.
