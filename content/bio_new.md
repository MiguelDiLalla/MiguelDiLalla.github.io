### Early Years & Education

---

I was born in Caracas in 1998, part of a generation raised between the promise of the digital revolution and the shifting political tides of Latin America. I received my early education at **Colegio Champagnat**, a prestigious private school in Caracas founded by the Marist Brothers. Known for its high academic standards, humanistic values, and freedom of belief, Champagnat nurtured both my logical-scientific strengths and my expressive, artistic side. There, I was an active participant in *SkenaTE*, a youth theater workshop led by renowned playwright and alumnus Basilio Álvarez.

I later enrolled in **Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV)**, one of Latin America's top-tier universities and a UNESCO World Heritage site. I successfully completed six out of ten semesters in Metallurgical Engineering at UCV's then recently established School of Materials' Sciences funded by the Orinoco Steel Arc—an initiative that, though several decades past its founding, continues to represent a legacy of industrial ambition and scientific advancement in the country. My time at UCV was marked by interdisciplinary friendships, community, and exploration: I joined the university's swimming team and continued my stage training with *Piso Rojo*, an experimental contemporary dance collective.

### Professional Growth

---

What started as a short visit to Tenerife evolved into a formative chapter in my life. Accessing the job market through hospitality, I gained financial independence, built confidence in my English, and honed my interpersonal skills by engaging with people from all over the world.

> *"Hospitality taught me how to manage stress in demanding environments—and the immense value of emotional intelligence."*

### Passion for Learning

---

Yet I never stopped feeling that my true home was in spaces of learning. My childhood was shaped by technical documentaries, scientific content, philosophical reflection, and classrooms where my greeting was often: "Did you know…?". I originally aspired to study Physics and Psychology, but chose Materials Engineering as a pragmatic middle ground—seeking the closest path to the physical world's inner workings. I naturally excelled in the sciences, especially programming, where I fondly recall solving assignments alongside my friend Andrea, turning every algorithm into a playground of creative refinement.

I continue to stay updated on breakthroughs in science and technology out of pure devotion to knowledge itself. I find inspiration and direction in listening to some of the world's foremost thinkers—such as Sam Harris and Esther Perel—whose ideas fuel my evolving mindset and commitment to becoming a future-oriented professional.

> *"The classroom has always been my habitat. It's where I breathe best."*

### Self-Guided Learning Journey

---

Aware that a formal university title is not the only indicator of talent, I embraced a new way of learning—self-guided and rooted in cutting-edge technology. Through platforms like Coursera, GitHub, YouTube, and tools like ChatGPT Plus and GitHub Copilot Pro, I built my own technical learning environment. I am part of the new generation of professionals who see large language models not merely as tools, but as tailor-made tutors that unlock creativity and unblock hesitation.

I began this new phase with Google's introductory data analytics course on Coursera, which marked the start of my professional transition into the tech world. During the COVID-19 lockdown, I completed Yale's *Science of Wellbeing*—a course that proved personally transformative. It helped me navigate the emotional weight of the pandemic and even empowered me to take on online freelance illustration work that financed my first month after emigrating to Spain.

More recently, I completed a Data Science bootcamp at **Hack A Boss**, one of many educational initiatives developed to keep European talent aligned with digital transformation. There, I solidified my knowledge through hands-on projects and formed bonds with fellow learners from diverse backgrounds, all seeking to change industries through tech.

Earlier, in my final year of high school and early university days, I earned software certifications from **ARTS Digital Institute** in Venezuela, training in Adobe and Autodesk tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, AutoCAD, 3ds Max, and Inventor.

### Flagship Projects & Portfolio Highlights

---

This journey has culminated in a portfolio that bridges science, creativity, and personal story.

#### 🧱 LEGO Bricks ML Vision

A full computer vision system I designed to identify and classify LEGO bricks from images. Inspired by childhood play, I asked myself a deceptively simple question:

> *"If I can recognize a LEGO piece instantly, can a machine learn to do the same?"*

The project evolved into a technically rich architecture that integrates **YOLOv8 for detection**, **keypoint detection for stud mapping**, and a regression-based algorithm to classify bricks by shape. I not only demonstrated technical acumen, but also crafted a polished CLI and a Streamlit demo—visually clear, intuitive, and fully documented.

> *"Every ML model begins like a sketch: an idea, a draft, a thousand mistakes—and finally, a solution that breathes."* 🌈

This project is my manifesto—entirely self-built, self-financed, and driven by a deep belief that learning, when fueled by passion, can be transformative.

#### ⏳ FlowLoops — A Playful Time Tracker

FlowLoops is a minimalist, installable **Progressive Web App** that I developed to help users focus by **hiding the passage of time** behind playful randomness. Designed for people who struggle with visible timers, it offers a sensory-friendly interface where each button launches a mystery countdown. Built with **Vanilla JS, TailwindCSS, and HTML5**, it works entirely offline and includes a session history system.

> *"Built with patience and curiosity—for anyone who wants to reclaim their time playfully."*

FlowLoops reflects my emerging interest in UX and mental wellness through design, offering a glimpse of how I blend functionality and feeling.

### Current Opportunity: PONOS Initiative

---

Currently, I am part of **PONOS**, a local youth employment initiative offering a fully subsidized three-month position in a company, with my salary funded by the regional government. As part of the program's workshops, I discovered the power of storytelling and self-presentation in job seeking—leading me to craft this very portfolio.

> *"What I offer isn't just knowledge—I offer direction, enthusiasm, and a grounded will to grow."* 🌟

I am ready to make the leap. My story, which began in an industrial workshop in Caracas and continued through restaurant shifts and library coding sessions in Tenerife, is a story of courageous transition. Now, I seek a company willing to bet on the future—on someone who has already proven he'll learn whatever it takes to bring value from day one.
