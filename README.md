# Miguel Di Lalla ‚Äî Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website: [migueldilalla.github.io](https://migueldilalla.github.io/). It reflects the current state of my technical and creative knowledge, serving as a gateway to both my background and selected projects.

### ‚ú® Site Overview
Inspired by top-tier developer portfolios, this site follows a clear, focused structure:

- **Bio Section** ‚Äî Featuring an interactive podcast-style introduction generated from my own bio using **Google Notebook LM's "text-to-podcast"** feature. Two virtual hosts guide the listener through my profile, adding dynamism to the static format.
- **Projects Section** ‚Äî Highlighting a curated set of personal and professional experiments.
- **Contact Section** ‚Äî For direct outreach and connection.

You're invited to explore the site thoroughly and listen to the podcasted bio for an immersive overview of my current professional journey.

### üß† Design Philosophy
The site adopts a visually bold and playful style, with a vivid color palette (yellows, reds, and blacks), large fonts, and friendly typographic hierarchy. Its layout is mobile-optimized and scroll-guided, encouraging exploration of each section as a standalone experience.

The portfolio emphasizes:

- **Simplicity & clarity**, both in code and interface.
- **Static deployment** for maximum accessibility and ease of hosting.
- **Clean UX structure** inspired by the best beginner-to-intermediate personal sites.
- **Audio integration** as a unique layer of interactivity.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **HTML5** for structure and semantics
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactive elements
- **Custom animations** and scroll-based interactivity
- **Markdown-based content blocks**
- **Audio playback** controlled via JavaScript
- **GitHub Pages** static deployment
